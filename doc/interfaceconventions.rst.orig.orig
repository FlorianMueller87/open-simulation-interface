Interface Conventions
======================

When adding new messages, enums, field messages and field enums to OSI we enforce a few naming conventions for each type like in the `style guide <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style>`_ from protobuf.

Message Naming
---------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
A message definition should always be in PascalCase. This means that the first letter of each word in a message should be upper case without any spaces. See example below:
=======
A message definition should always be in camel case. This means that the first letter of each word in a message should be upper case without any spaces. See example below:
>>>>>>> Documentation/interface convention (#380)

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message EnvironmentalConditions
    {
    }

Top-Level Messages
-------------------
All messages that are intended to be exchanged as a stand-alone message, i.e. not required to be embedded in another message, like e.g. ``SensorView`` or ``SensorViewConfiguration``, are required to carry an ``InterfaceVersion`` field as their first field, and a ``Timestamp`` field as their second field, e.g.:

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message TopLevel
    {
        // The interface version used by the sender (simulation environment).
        //
        optional InterfaceVersion version = 1;
        
        // The data timestamp of the simulation environment. Zero time is arbitrary
        // but must be identical for all messages. Zero time does not need to
        // coincide with the UNIX epoch. Recommended is the starting time point of
        // the simulation.
        //
        optional Timestamp timestamp = 2;
    }

Field Message Naming
---------------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
After defining a message fields can be added to it in snake_case format. This means every letter is lower case and the words are connected through an underline character. See example below:

>>>>>>> Fullfilled a rebase with sign off.

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message EnvironmentalConditions
    {
        optional double atmospheric_pressure = 1;
    }

Field Numbering
----------------

Fields should be numbered consecutively starting from 1 on first definition. During maintenance, the rules of backward/forward-compatibility require that fields are never renumbered, and field numbers never re-used unless a major release is performed.

All field numbers of 10000 and above are reserved for user-defined extensions and will thus never be used by OSI message fields.

Enum Naming
------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
The naming of an enum should be PascalCase. See example below:
=======
The naming of an enum should be camel case. See example below:
>>>>>>> Documentation/interface convention (#380)

    message EnvironmentalConditions
    {
        optional double atmospheric_pressure = 1;

        enum AmbientIllumination
        {
        }
    }

Enum Field Naming
------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
The naming of an enum field should be all in upper case. The start should be converted from the enum name PascalCase to UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE. It is mandatory to add to the first enum field name the postfix ``_UNKNOWN`` and to the second the postfix ``_OTHER``. After that the naming can be decided by the user. It is often mentioned that the value ``_UNKNOWN`` should not be used in a ``GroundTruth`` message as there are now uncertanties by definition in ``the truth``. These values are mostly used in messages like ``SensorData`` where the content is subject to interpretation. See example below:

            AMBIENT_ILLUMINATION_OTHER = 1;

            AMBIENT_ILLUMINATION_LEVEL1 = 2;
        }
    }

After defining the messages do not forget to comment them. See also the `section for commenting <https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-documentation/open-simulation-interface/doc/commenting.html>`_ of fields and messages.
